# Security Policy

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it privately so we can investigate and fix it.

Preferred: Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" to open a private advisory (Security tab → Report a vulnerability).

If that is not possible, open a private discussion with maintainers to request a confidential channel.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
